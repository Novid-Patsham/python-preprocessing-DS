   Do
   Ned
   Ten
   is
   too
   young
   see
   such
   things
   All
   these
   years
   and
   still
   feel
   like
   an
   outsider
   when
   come
   here
   wonder
   if
   the
   old
   agree
   am
   so
   sorry
   love
   but
   they
   grow
   fast
   How
   many
   times
   told
   want
   promise
   me
   more
   Your
   Grace
   queen
